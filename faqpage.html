            <p class="faq-text">
                We design and develop custom software that helps organizations work more efficiently.
                Every solution is built around real needs — no unnecessary features, no clutter.
                Just what's needed to make things work smoothly.

            <summary class="faq-question">What types of software do you build?</summary>
            <p class="faq-text">
                Our work ranges from internal tools and workflow platforms to
                data dashboards and integration systems. We build solutions that simplify daily operations
                — especially for teams in business, logistics, and IT.

            <summary class="faq-question">How do you approach new projects?</summary>
            <p class="faq-text">
                We start by understanding how your organization works and where things can be improved.
                From there, we design and develop software that fits — not the other way around.
                Throughout the process, you'll have one clear point of contact.

            <summary class="faq-question">What makes Circle Solutions different?</summary>
            <p class="faq-text">
                Simplicity. We don't add complexity where it's not needed. Our software is clean,
                functional, and reliable — focused on usability and long-term value.
            </p>

            <summary class="faq-question">Do you offer off-the-shelf products?</summary>
            <p class="faq-text">
                No. Every solution we create is custom-built for the client's specific context and goals.
                This ensures that your software fits your processes — instead of forcing your processes to fit the
                software.

            <p class="faq-text">
                We follow a clear, structured development process with built-in testing at every step.
                Our code is maintainable, well-documented, and ready to grow with your organization.

            <p class="faq-text">
                After launch, we stay available for support and further development.
                Many of our clients continue working with us to refine or expand their systems as their needs
                evolve.
